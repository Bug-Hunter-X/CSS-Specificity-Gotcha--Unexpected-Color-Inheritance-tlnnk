The solution involves a deeper understanding of CSS specificity and adjusting selectors accordingly:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div.container p {
  color: blue !important;
}

div p {
  color: red; 
}
```

By adding `!important` to the first selector, we override the second selector.  Alternatively, we can restructure selectors to make the intent clearer:

```css
/* Alternative Solution */
.container p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

This solution makes it clear that the `p` elements within the container should be blue, and all other `p` elements should be red.
